Brian, this whole place is in shambles. I managed to bar entry from the upper floors with the Administrator Card for the floor but who knows how long that will help me. I hid the card in the General Assembly storage in case you end up coming up here. No wonder things have felt off, we lost control over the one AI that controls 80% of the damn facility!
