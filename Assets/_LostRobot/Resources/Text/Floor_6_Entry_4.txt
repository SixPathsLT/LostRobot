Hey Juan,
I think I might have found a solution for the issue we've been facing re: integrating nanotech with fertilizer. I dropped my keycard in one of the plants in the artificial gardens a few weeks ago and when I tried to retrieve it less than a day later, the roots somehow broke it down and absorbed the metal. What's more, the plant doesn't look like it's dying any more. 
I think I can safely conclude that this is the effect of our new nanotech-integrated fertilizer, because no normal plant can do that. I've started leaving keycards in the artificial gardens to gather more data on this phenomenon. Just don't tell Diane, I think she'd categorize this experiment as a "serious compromise in security" and a "waste of resources".
