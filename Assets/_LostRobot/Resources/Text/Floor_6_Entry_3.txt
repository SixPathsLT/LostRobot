Dear BRIAN BRYANT,
Unfortunately we cannot complete your request to send the following email to CANDICE MARTINEZ at this time. There was an error with our servers.

Candice the facility is a mess! None of the changes I made to the AI's algorithms made a difference and when I tried to get to the servers to shut the entire system down, it sent security bots after me and chased me out of there. You have to tell everyone to get out of here as soon as possible. I have no idea how safe this facility is any more.
Good luck,
-[Electrical Engineer] Brian Bryant

Please contact the maintenance team for further assistance or try again later.
