Hey Brian, could you do me a favor and keep a spare of my Access card there by your desk please. We will begin discussions regarding further steps for adjustments to the electronics and you guys might need to have access to my Office to get some files from the cabinets there.I might also be slightly busy during this time and have to go to other floors, hence the spare card so that even while Iâ€™m not on the floor you can still come and go to get the files that you need from there. Just don't use it to go to other departments please.

Regards
-[Head of Diagnostics & Assembly] Tiffany Scott
