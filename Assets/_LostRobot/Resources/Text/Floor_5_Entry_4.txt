Kevin, I need your help if you’re still here. I hid in the lockers after the Security droids went AWOL but I lost my access card somewhere in there and now I can't get out of this damn floor. I’m going to try going back there and looking for it but recently I heard someone screaming after they got caught, these things aren't just catching us anymore they seem to have become a lot more violent. If you’re still down by the assembly room then I wish you the best of luck, I going to get that access card and try to make a run for it 

Regards
