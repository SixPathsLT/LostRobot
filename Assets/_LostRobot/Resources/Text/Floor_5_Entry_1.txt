You need to find a place to hide, that general staff meeting was a setup. The director did not send out that email, the crazy AI did. The moment most of us got there the place was overrun with security droids who started restraining people. I managed to slip by but I’m not sure if I’m safe here. You stayed in the lower floors since you were adamant about continuing your work and that seems to have been luck playing a part but you need to find a place to hide. Who knows what the AI is planning to do with the people it caught.
