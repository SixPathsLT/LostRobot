Hey Carl, welcome to the team!
Glad to have you onboard with our grand quest of recreating human-like intelligence. Although we mostly just work on the bodies so that the AI has a vessel to move around in. Your main task will mostly center around making sure that the balancing of the Units work without issue. If you have any questions though feel free to ask either me or anyone else on the team, weâ€™d be more than happy to help.

Regards
-[Head of Mechanics] Lauren Washington
