To all employees,
This is a general notice for all employees working on the third floor. It has come to my attention that someone has been leaving elevator access keycards in the Artificial Garden. This is highly inappropriate behavior and could result in a serious compromise in the security of this facility. The perpetrator of this offense is advised to step up now or face grave consequences. 

Regards,
-[Head of Security] Diane Kemp
