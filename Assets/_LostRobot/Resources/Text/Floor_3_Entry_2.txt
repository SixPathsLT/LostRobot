Dear DANNY MARTIN,
Congratulations on becoming a part of the Wintech team! As one of the leading companies in AI development, we pride ourselves on our cutting-edge technology. While androids have become commonplace in most households, they are currently incapable of doing anything beyond their pre-programmed tasks. Our goal here at this facility is to instill human-like intelligence in robots in order to create bots that are capable of imitating complex thought processes with the end goal of being able to support humanity and assist us with advancing technology further.
Your orientation is scheduled for [next day] at 12 PM. Please note that access to certain areas of the facility is restricted unless you have the appropriate keycard, which will be granted to you when you achieve the proper clearance level.

Regards, 
Wintech Labs
