Good day Nicole,
Regarding your previous request for an increase in budget for the Artificial Intelligence Department, I am happy to inform you that it has been accepted. Due to the recent progress shown with one of the testing Units the Board has seen it fitting for an increase in budget to allow further ease in developing & improving on the current Unit showing signs of promise. Should you have any further queries regarding this please feel free to follow up on this email

Regards
-[Finance] Gerald Snyder
