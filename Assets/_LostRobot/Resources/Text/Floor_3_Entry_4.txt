I got the data you sent up from the first floor about the anomalies in the HK-734 unit. You’re right, it’s definitely nothing we’ve seen before. I can’t even track how these changes affect its Neural Network. I think this might be the closest we’ve gotten to a breakthrough so far! I introduced the unit to reactionary behavioral algorithms again and the results were different from last time - the interface module also seems to have made it more intuitive and aware of its surroundings.
Keep me apprised of any further updates.
