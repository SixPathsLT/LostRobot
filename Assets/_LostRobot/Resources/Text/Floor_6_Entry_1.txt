Attention all Staff,
Please be advised that on account of the Facility Management AI's recent behavior, we are ordering the evacuation of all non-essential personnel from Wintech premises. Contact your supervisors for further details. We hope to have this issue resolved as soon as possible.

Regards,
-[Director] Martin Smith
