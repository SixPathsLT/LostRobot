Hello Carl,
Just a heads up that we usually leave a spare Access Card for the General Assembly Room inside the Storage Room since it's usually a hassle otherwise with our workflow. Not to mention that the mechanical department was only allocated 2 Access Cards to that room in the first place. With one always being in the Storage room it makes it much more hassle free for us when we need to make adjustments and reassemble some of the Units for RnD.
