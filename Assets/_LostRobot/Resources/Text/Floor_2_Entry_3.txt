Ummm, hey Jona, you notice how the Security bots have been acting funny for the past while. I can't make sense of why they were patrolling some of the areas they were or why they were out and about in the first place considering that they are usually only active on the upper floors closer to the facility entrance. I mean we're underground for goodness sake and the only ways that a person can go are down or up. I plan on bringing this up to my HoD soon but just wanted to give you a heads up since they seem to have taken an interest in whatever project you guys have been busy with recently on the lower floors.
